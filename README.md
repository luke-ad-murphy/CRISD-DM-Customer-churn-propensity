# CRISP-DM Customer Churn Propensity Model
A step-by-step example to building a customer churn propensity (classifier) model using the industry-standard CRISP-DM framework.

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the process of developing a customer churn propensity model following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework.

While this example is specific to the telecommunications industry, the methodology can be adapted for other customer churn use cases across various domains.

Broadly, the 3 codes sections included provide:

# 1 - Data understanding and exploration
Descrtiptive statistics for data attributes and visualisations

# 2 - Data preparation
Treatments applied based on the findgs from step 1 (e.g., discarding attributes, imputing missing values)

# 3 - Modelling
Testing a variety of techniques and hyperparameters and assessing overall results using various statistics and performance charts.
